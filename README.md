# Global Smoking Analysis
## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of global smoking patterns using a multi-year dataset across countries. It explores smoking prevalence, consumption, mortality, taxation, and policy enforcement through advanced data visualizations. The goal is to uncover regional and temporal trends, assess the effectiveness of tobacco control measures, and highlight dominant brands shaping consumption globally.

By combining statistical graphics, geospatial mapping, and per capita normalization, this analysis delivers actionable insights into the public health impact of smoking worldwide.
